Licence Keys

If you are provided with a unique licence key in connection with the Rasa Software, this licence key is necessary for activating and accessing the Rasa Software. You cannot share the license key provided by Rasa nor share the access credentials to the Rasa Software. If you wish to transfer the license to a new user, you must get a new license key directly from Rasa. If the licence key expires, the related rights will also expire.

Product-Specific Terms

The Rasa Developer Edition License is not provided with a technical support package. If you want this type of support, reach out to our sales team for our commercial products and services. Still, we'll try to help you out. You can reach out to us and other developers in our forum.

Rasa Developer Edition

You can obtain a copy of the Rasa Developer Edition by requesting a licence key to Rasa by email. The Rasa Developer Edition is offered free of charge, and is subject to a limited licence. The following uses are permitted:

Use on individual workstations, including laptops and desktops, intended for direct use by a single user.
Use in cloud-based remote development environments, such as GitHub Codespaces or similar platforms, where the development environment is hosted on a cloud provider's infrastructure but acts as an individual, isolated, environment.
Use on Docker Desktop running on Mac, Windows or Linux. You can also use the Product in a commercial production environment, subject to the usage restrictions below. Once you reach these limitations, you can contact us, and we'll be happy to transition you to a commercial license.
Use Case	Conversation	Example
Internal Use	You can use the license for an internal use case for up to 100 conversations per month.	The implementation of a chatbot to manage internal communication as part of employee onboarding.
External Use	You can use the license for an external use case for up to 1000 conversations per month.	The use of a Custom Assistant for a customer service website to provide users with support.
You can use the licence for one use case, whether internal or external. If you have another use case, you will be required to obtain a commercial licence. A "use case" means a specific application or implementation of the Rasa software to demonstrate its capabilities or explore its benefits. For each use case, there is also a limit on the number of conversations that can be processed through the Rasa Developer Edition License. A "conversation" refers to an interaction between the chatbot and a user. Any dialogue session in which messages are sent during a month counts towards the monthly limit.

You can only use this limited licence once for your organization. You can't circumvent the licence restrictions, including by using affiliates or other companies to deploy more use cases or conversations.

Each licence key is provided for a licence term of 12 months. If you need your licence longer, you can reach out to us for a renewal. To ensure the continuous improvement and enhancement of the Rasa Developer Edition License, the telemetry features, which collect and transmit usage data, must remain active. This data helps Rasa analyze and optimize the Rasa Software through the licence. Disabling these features is not permitted.

Ethical Uses of Custom Assistants

The Customer Assistant relies on AI to respond to and interact with Users, including to execute some actions at User's request. The way an AI solution, such as a Custom Assistant, is deployed or used may change the ethical characteristics of the system. We expect you to build, train and use Custom Assistants in an ethical manner including by applying the following principles:

Safeguarding the right to human agency by providing appropriate oversight mechanisms to prevent possible adverse effects and uphold human autonomy.
Avoiding the use of the Custom Assistant to subordinate, coerce, deceive, or manipulate people, including to create attachment or stimulate addiction.
Using AI in a transparent and accountable manner, including to explain any decisions made by the Custom Assistant.
Although we recognize that the principle of fairness is difficult to define and that there can be a gray zone, we expect you to develop Custom Assistant without biases and discrimination against Users.
We do not recommend the use of profiling and automated decision-making when such technologies can cause harm to individuals. If you use our Custom Assistant for these purposes, you do so at your sole risk.
You are responsible for training, customizing and optimizing your Custom Assistant based on your needs. This training and optimization can be done on an ongoing basis, such as by reviewing feedback and annotating responses from User. You must have the right to use the training data for this purpose, including by ensuring that it does not constitute a violation of Data Protection Laws.
Unless we agree otherwise in a contract, we are not responsible for configuring the Custom Assistants, including, to personalize it to your business model.
